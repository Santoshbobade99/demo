    <h1>What is IPO?</h1>
    <div class="main">
    <p>
      An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process through which a private company becomes a public company by offering its shares to the general public for the first time. <br> This process involves several key details and stages:</p>

      </div>
      <ol>
         <li><h3>Preparation:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Selection of Underwriters: Companies usually hire investment banks or financial institutions to act as underwriters. Underwriters help in determining the IPO price and assist in the issuance process.</li>
               <li>Due Diligence: The company undergoes a thorough examination of its financial and operational aspects. This is to ensure that the information provided to potential investors is accurate and complete. </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li><h3>Filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The company files a registration statement with the SEC, providing details about its financials, operations, and future plans.</li>
               <li>The SEC reviews the filing to ensure compliance with regulations and to protect investors' interests.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li><h3>Quiet Period:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>After filing with the SEC, there is typically a "quiet period" during which the company and underwriters refrain from making public statements about the offering.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li><h3>Roadshow:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The company and underwriters conduct a roadshow to promote the IPO to potential investors. This involves presentations and meetings to showcase the company's potential and attract interest.</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li><h3>Pricing:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The underwriters and the company determine the IPO price, which is the price at which the shares will be offered to the public. This is a crucial step, as it influences the amount of capital the company can raise and the valuation of the company.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li><h3>Allotment and Listing:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Once the IPO price is set, shares are allotted to institutional and retail investors based on demand.
               </li>
               <li>The company's shares are officially listed on a stock exchange, and trading begins.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         
      <li><h3>Post-IPO:</h3> 
         <ul>
            <li>The company is now subject to public scrutiny and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>Shareholders, including employees and early investors, may have the opportunity to sell their shares on the open market.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      </ol>
     <h3>Key IPO dates include:</h3>
